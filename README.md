## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Charles Chen

I build software for startups, for enterprises, but also for fun and curiosity.

Curious about my takes on AI, LLMs, front-end stacks, .NET, and various other topics?  Check out my writing:

I also have a tendency to collect side projects ðŸ¤£.  Here are a few:

- https://turas.app - travel planning web app and Chrome extension for well-organized travelers
- https://coderev.app - interview tool for assessing candidates using code review instead of/in addition to leetcode
- https://zeeq.ai - an AI agent that watches the feed from ClinicalTrials.gov and provides a personalized update stream to your inbox
